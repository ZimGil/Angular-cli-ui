This Project was discontinued when [Angular Console](https://angularconsole.com/) was released

## How to use

### Globally

#### Installation
```
npm install -g https://github.com/ZimGil/ngWiz.git
```
<!-- change this once this is published to the npm package name -->

#### Usage
Go to your development folder (where you keep your projects) and run
```
ng-wiz
```
to open that folder.

If you run that command inside an angular project, that project will be open in `ng-wiz`

### As a dependency

#### Installation
Install `ng-wiz` as a dev dependency in your node.js project by running
```
npm install --save-dev https://github.com/ZimGil/ngWiz.git
```
<!-- change this once this is published to the npm package name -->

#### Usage
You can use `ng-wiz` directly by running
```
npx ng-wiz
```
Or by calling it with an npm script
```
"scripts": {
  // ...
  "ng-wiz": "ng-wiz"
}
```
Then, you can run it with
```
npm run ng-wiz
```
