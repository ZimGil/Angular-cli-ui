## <a name="development"></a> How to develop `ng-wiz`

In order to run `ng-wiz` in development mode, clone the repository locally with
```
git clone https://github.com/ZimGil/ngWiz.git
```

go into the newly created folder and install all dependencies 
```
cd ng-wiz
npm install
```
This will also build the application and create an initial `dist` folder.

To see code changes, run build after you make your changes
to create the `dist` folder:
```
npm run build
```

after that, start `ng-wiz` again.

### <a name="run-locally"></a> Run `ng-wiz` locally
This will run `ng-wiz` in developer mode with
`ng-wiz`'s folder as root
```
npm start
```

### <a name="run-globally"></a> Run `ng-wiz` globally
If you want to test ng-wiz as if it was installed globally, run
```
npm link
```
This will create a semantic link to the repo's folder. You can run `ng-wiz` in your command line
from anywhere. Any changes will take effect after a restart.

## <a name="unit-tests"></a> Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## <a name="ee-tests"></a> Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
